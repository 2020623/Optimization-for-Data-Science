This project is the implementation of the Algorithms ZSCG, FZFW and FZCGS of the paper:

In particular the task is applied to the objective function proposed by Gao and Huang for the
generation of Adversarial examples.

We recommend to open the notebook with Colab if is possible, in order to have a
better visualization.
Moreover, the weights used in the notebook come from  https://github.com/IBM/ZOSVRG-BlackBox-Adv/tree/master/models.

Enjoy!
