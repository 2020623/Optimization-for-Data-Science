This is the project related to the "Optimization for Data Science" course, delivered in the "Data Science" master's degree.
In this project there is the Python implementation of:
- Zeroth-order stochastic conditional gradient, proposed by (Balasubramian et al., 2018)
- Faster zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe, proposed by (Gao et al., 2020)
- Faster zeroth-order conditional gradient sliding, proposed by (Gao et al., 2020)
Both the papers are available in this repository. In particular, the task is applied to the generation of adversarial examples 
following the lines of the experiment in (Gao et al., 2020).
